    <div class="box">
        <p>I suppose you want to test something. Here are some options, though I fail to see the point. It will probably just fail anyway.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt to upload a file? <em>(Why bother? It'll just take up space.)</em></li>
            <li>Run a pointless CGI script? <em>(Prepare for disappointment.)</em></li>
            <li>Go somewhere else? <em>(Don't let me stop you. Not that you could.)</em></li>
            <li>Try making coffee? <em>(The universe is bleak enough without bad coffee.)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't blame me if none of this works. I have a brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to serve web pages. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't.</p>
